# form-validation-with-pure-javascript
This tutorial will show you how to create a JavaScript-enabled form that checks whether a user has filled in the form correctly before it’s sent to the server. This is called form validation. First we’ll explain why form validation is a useful thing, and then build up a simple example form, explaining things as we go along. 

Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.
